    // 1. What is Inheritance?

    // Inheritance (Simple English):
    // Inheritance (noun): Something that we "inherit" from some(thing/one).
    // Inheritance (verb): The act of acquiring a property/trait/behaviour/attribute
    // by one ENTITY from ANOTHER ENTITY related to it.(because we are realted to our parents)
    // Entity: A human being, any living thing, any non-living thing.

    // Real-Life Examples:
    // 1. We have inherited our physical attributes from our parents:
    // ex - Hair color, Color of eyes, Height, etc.
    // These attributes are inherited by YOU from YOUR PARENTS.
    // 2. Some money, a house, a car, a piece of land ... etc.
    // There properties are inherited by a CHILD from THEIR PARENTS, if they so choose.

    // Inheritance (Object-Oriented): The entity is a class!
    // Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can acquire
    // the properties(fields/variables) and/or methods of another class related to it.

    // 2. How we can use Inheritance to re-use code/programs/software that are already developed and tested.

    // Re-Use of a code/program/software :
    // It means that if some developer(s) have created a code/program/software,
    // we can modify the code/program/software without having to start from scratch.

    // 1. use this software as an end-user:
    // we will simply download the final product, install it, and use it.
    // An end-user might not be an engineer, or a person that knows how to write code.

    // 2. use this software as a developer:
    // we can observe/modify the source code of the software according to our liking.

    // The types of software that exist in the world:
    // 1. Open Source Software: The Java JDK is also a part of Open Source.
    //  i. will allow you to observe and/or modify the source code.
    // 2. Closed Source Software, ex - Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office

    // 3. Observe how to use the `extends` keyword.
    // 4. What is a `super` class and what is a `sub` class.
    // 5. How we can access the members of a super class from a sub class.
    // 6. Constructor Hierarchy.
    // 7. Method Overriding, Dynamic Method Dispatch, Abstract Classes & Interfaces.
    // 8. How to model our programs using all of the above concepts.
